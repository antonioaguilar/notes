# UX Notes - Material Design

## Introduction

Material Design is a new UX/UI framework for mobile, table and desktop computers. There are several active projects which cover Google's Material Design specification:

* [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/)
* [Material Design Lite](http://www.getmdl.io/)
* [Polymer Components](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/)

Components need to be re-loaded dynamically on route change to enable ripple and animation effects.
